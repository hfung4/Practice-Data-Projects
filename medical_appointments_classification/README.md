**Medical appointments classification**

- A sample "take-home" assignment for data science interviews.
- The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient will show up or not for their medical appointments.
- In this notebook, I will perform data wrangling, exploratory analysis, modelling and hyperparameters tuning.
